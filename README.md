# Programs from CSC 101

## Overview  
This repository contains programming projects and assignments I completed during my **CSC 101: Introduction to Computer Science** course. These projects provided hands-on experience with foundational coding concepts and problem-solving techniques using Python. Through these exercises, I gained skills in debugging, designing algorithms, and building basic applications, setting the stage for more advanced studies in computer science.

## Learning Objectives  
During this course, I focused on:  
- Understanding programming fundamentals, including loops, conditionals, and data structures.  
- Writing reusable and modular code using functions and classes.  
- Developing problem-solving strategies to implement algorithms.  
- Debugging and testing Python programs effectively.
